# Description
The aim of this project was to create a command-line application that produced a ReadMe file from the user input information.

This application will allow users to create a ReadMe file based on their answers to the questions. Their answers will automatically save to a markdown ReadMe file which will allow them to push this directly to their repository and their ReadMe will be complete.

Please see a video of the working application [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D1m9IniPaBSeB45HhZ4LLqbtFlWV-aMj/preview)

And please see the result once pushed to a Github Repository [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16cvczv3H1gqSNFOoLh8dkiY4crZPH0xY/view)

# Installation 
In order to use this application, users will need to download the index.js file as well as download node.js in order for the application to run in the terminal. (The user can also download the repository if they wish to have all of the code) They will then be able to access the new ReadMe file that has been created using their answers. They can then do as neccessary with this, including pushing it to their repository and this will display as desired.

# Improvements
If i were to have the opportunity to continue with this project, i would like to add more License options in order to of use to as many users as possible.
